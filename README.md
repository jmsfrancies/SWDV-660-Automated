# SWDV-660-Automated

### Python File that will test the fizz buzz test.
### The Fizz Buzz test will test numbers that are divisible by 3, 5, or both 3 and 5.
### Any number that isn't divisible by 3 and 5 will be printed on the screen.
### Any Number divisible by three and not by five will have the string output "fizz".
### Any number divisible by five and not by three will have the string output "buzz".
### Any number divisible by both three and five will have the string output "fizz buzz".
### I have recently updated the automated test!
